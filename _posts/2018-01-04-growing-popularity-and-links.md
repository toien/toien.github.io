For search engines that crawl the vast metropolis of the web, links are the 
streets between pages. Using sophisticated link analysis, the engines can 
discover how pages are related to each other and in what ways.

对于爬取海量页面的搜索引擎来说，链接是页面之间的通道。
通过复杂的链接分析，搜索引擎可以发现页面之间是如何关联，又是以什么方式关联的。

Since the late 1990s search engines have treated links as votes for popularity 
and importance in the ongoing democratic opinion poll of the web. The engines 
themselves have refined the use of link data to a fine art, and use complex 
algorithms to perform nuanced evaluations of sites and pages based on this 
information.

自从90年代末，搜索引擎将链接视为持续进行的 web 内容热度和重要性的民意调查投票。
搜索引擎已经在链接数据的使用上达到精进，并使用复杂的算法，基于这些信息对网站和页面进行细致的评估。

Links aren't everything in SEO, but search professionals attribute a large 
portion of the engines' algorithms to link-related factors (see Search Engine 
Ranking Factors). Through links, engines can not only analyze the popularity 
websites and pages based on the number and popularity of pages linking to them, 
but also metrics like trust, spam, and authority. Trustworthy sites tend to 
link to other trusted sites, while spammy sites receive very few links from 
trusted sources (see MozTrust). Authority models, like those postulated in the 
Hilltop Algorithm, suggest that links are a very good way of identifying expert 
documents on a given subject.

链接并非 SEO 的全部，但是搜索专家把搜索算法的一大部分归因于链接相关因子（[搜索排名因子](https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors)）。
通过链接，引擎不仅可以根据链接到网页的页面的数量和流行度来分析流行网站和页面，还可以分析信任，垃圾邮件和权威等指标。
值得信耐的站点倾向于链接其他同样值得信耐的站点，许多垃圾站点几乎不从出现在受信任的站点上（[MozTrust](https://moz.com/learn/seo/moztrust)）。
权威模型，例如在 [Hilltop 算法](ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/reports/csri/405/hilltop.html) 中假设一样，表明链接是识别给定主题的专业文档的一种非常好的方法。

Thanks to this focus on algorithmic and analysis of links, growing the link 
profile of a website is critical to gaining traction, attention, and traffic 
from the engine.
AS an SEO, link building is among the top tasks required for search ranking and 
traffic success.

由于专注在链接上的算法和分析，对一个网站而言：持续增长的链接剖析对于从搜索引擎获取流量至关重要。
作为 SEO，链接构建是获取搜索排名和流量成功的首要任务。

### Link Signals

### 链接信号

Used by search engines
How do search engines assign value to links? To answer this, we need to explore 
the individual elements of a link, and look at how the search engines assess 
these elements. We don't fully understand the proprietary metrics that search 
engines use, but through analysis of patent applications, years of experience, 
and hands-on testing, we can draw some intelligent assumptions that hold up in 
the real world. Below is a list of notable factors worthy of consideration. 
These signals, and many more, are considered by professional SEOs when measuring 
link value and a site's link profile. You may also enjoy some further on the 
Moz Blog reading about search engine valuation of links.

被搜索引擎使用
搜索引擎如何给链接赋值？
为了回答这个问题，我们需要探讨下链接包含的各个元素，看看搜索引擎如何评估这些元素。
我们无法完全理解搜索引擎使用的专有的测量方法，但是通过分析专利申请，多年的经验，加上动手测试，我们提出一些在现实世界中生效的假设。
如下所示，有一个值得注意的因子列表。
这些信号，还有很多其他的因素，是专业 SEO 衡量一个链接的价值和网站链接信息的考量。
你也许会从 Moz 博客中获取更多关于搜索引擎[链接价值评估](https://moz.com/blog/10-illustrations-on-search-engines-valuation-of-links)的有趣信息。

Global Popularity
The more popular and important a site is, the more links from that site matter. 
A site like Wikipedia has thousands of diverse sites linking to it, which means 
it's probably a popular and important site. To earn trust and authority with the 
engines, you'll need the help of other link partners. The more popular, the better.

全局热度
一个站点的热度和重要性越高，它上面的链接就越重要。
一个像 [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) 这样的站点，拥有上千个不同站点指向其的链接，意味着它可能是一个流行并且重要的站点。
为了从搜索引擎那里获取信任和权威性，你将会需要友情链接的帮助。越流行，越好。

Local/Topic-Specific Popularity
The concept of "local" popularity, first pioneered by the Teoma search engine, 
suggests that links from sites within a topic-specific community matter more 
than links from general or off-topic sites. For example, if your website sells 
dog houses, a link from the Society of Dog Breeders matters much more than one 
from a site about roller skating.

本地/特定主题的热度
本地热度的概念，被 Teoma 搜索引擎率先提出，建议在特定专题的社区出现的链接，应该比大众化站点或者离题的站点的链接更重要。
例如，如果你的站点在销售宠物狗舍，一个来自 Society of Dog Breeders 的链接比另一个来自轮滑网站的链接更重要。

Anchor Text
One of the strongest signals the engines use in rankings is anchor text. 
If dozens of links point to a page with the right keywords, that page has a very 
good probability of ranking well for the targeted phrase in that anchor text. 
You can see examples of this in action with searches like "click here," where 
many results rank solely due to the anchor text of inbound links.

锚文本
搜索引擎用于排名因素中，锚文本是最强的信号之一。
如果十几个链接用正确的关键词指向一个页面，那么这个页面就很有可能在锚文本描述的这些关键词上排名良好。
你可以通过搜索 “[click here](https://www.google.com/search?q=click+here&pws=0)” 查看例子，许多搜索结果由于锚文本排名不理想。

TrustRank
It's no surprise that the Internet contains massive amounts of spam. 
Some estimate as much as 60% of the web's pages are spam. In order to weed out 
this irrelevant content, search engines use systems for measuring trust, many 
of which are based on the link graph. Earning links from highly-trusted domains 
can result in a significant boost to this scoring metric. Universities, 
government websites and non-profit organizations represent examples of high-trust 
domains.

信任排名
毫无疑问，互联网上充斥大量垃圾信息。
有些评估报告声称大约有 60% 的网页是垃圾信息。
搜索引擎为了从淘汰这些不相关的内容，会使用系统来衡量信任度，许多系统基于链接图像。
在高信任度的域名获取链接可以让分数测量得到大幅提升。
大学，政府网站和非营利组织都是高信任域名的例子。

Link Neighborhood
Spam links often go both ways. A website that links to spam is likely spam itself, 
and in turn often has many spam sites linking back to it. By looking at these 
links in the aggregate, search engines can understand the "link neighborhood" in 
which your website exists. Thus, it's wise to choose those sites you link to 
carefully and be equally selective with the sites you attempt to earn links from.

链接邻居
垃圾链接一般是双向的。
一个链接到垃圾站点的站点往往本身也是垃圾站点，通常还有很多垃圾站点反向指向它。
通过聚合这些链接，搜索引擎可以理解你的站点的 “链接邻居” 。
所以，明智的做法是小心地选择你想要链接的他站，并且同样地选择你想要获取链接的站点。

Freshness
Link signals tend to decay over time. Sites that were once popular often go stale, 
and eventually fail to earn new links. Thus, it's important to continue earning 
additional links over time. Commonly referred to as "FreshRank," search engines 
use the freshness signals of links to judge current popularity and relevance.

新鲜度
链接型号会随着时间腐朽。曾经热门的网站经常会变得过时，最终很难从别的网站获取链接。
所以，随着时间持续地获取额外的链接很重要。
这通常称作 “新鲜度排名”，搜索引擎使用链接的新鲜度信号来判断当前的热度和相关性。

Social Sharing
The last few years have seen an explosion in the amount of content shared through 
social services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Although search engines 
treat socially shared links differently than other types of links, they notice 
them nonetheless. There is much debate among search professionals as to how 
exactly search engines factor social link signals into their algorithms, but 
there is no denying the rising importance of social channels.

社交分享
最近几年，通过像 Facebook, Twitter, Google+ 这样的社交网站分享内容爆炸式增长。
虽然搜索引擎对待社交分享的链接会不同于其它类型的链接，但不至于忽略。
在搜索专家里，关于搜索引擎在算法上如何处理社交分享链接因子有很大的争论，但不可否认社交渠道重要性的增长。

### The Power of Social Sharing

### 社交分享的威力

How Google+, Twitter, and Facebook Change the Game
The years 2011-2012 saw a huge rise in social sharing and its effects on search. 
Google, in particular, began to incorporate a huge number of social signals into 
its search results. This involves serving personalized results to logged-in users 
that include content shared by the searcher's social circle (Facebook, Twitter 
and others). These results might not always appear in the top ten, but are 
undoubtedly promoted due to this social influence.

Google+, Twitter, Facebook 如何改变游戏规则
2011-2012 年见证了社交分享对搜索影响的巨大提升。
特别是 Google，开始和在搜索结果中包含大量社交信号。
这涉及到对登录用户提供个性化的结果，这些结果中往往包含搜索用户社交圈中（Facebook, Twitter）的分享内容。
这些结果往往不会出现在前十位中，但毫无疑问地促进了社交影响力。

The potential power of this shift towards social for search marketers is huge. 
Someone with a large social circle, who shares a lot of material, is more likely 
to see that material (and her face) promoted in search results. For publishers, 
it's beneficial to have your content shared by these highly influential folks 
with large social followings. For Google searches, this is especially true of 
content shared on Google+.

这种改变对社交媒体在搜索市场的潜在影响是巨大的。
一个有着庞大社交圈的人，分享很多素材的人，更倾向于在搜索结果中看到自己的分享。
对于出版商来说，当你的内容被有很多粉丝关注的高影响力人物分享的时候，就会在搜索上获益。
对 Google 来说，特别是在 Google+ 上分享内容的时候。

Are Social Shares the Same as Links?
In a word: no. Although there is evidence that social shares such as Tweets, 
Likes, and Plusses affect rankings, at this time links are considered a far 
superior and more lasting way to promote the popularity of your content than 
any other method.

社交分享是否和链接一样？
一个字：不。证据显示虽然诸如：Tweet, Like, Plus 类的社交分享影响排名，但是就目前来看，链接在促进内容热度上比其它任何形式都更优先和更持久。

### Link Building Basics

### 链接构造基本

Link building is an art. It's almost always the most challenging part of an 
SEO's job, but also the one most critical to success. Link building requires 
creativity, hustle, and often, a budget. No two link building campaigns are the 
same, and the way you choose to build links depends as much upon your website as 
it does your personality. Below are three basic types of link acquisition.

链接构造是一门艺术。似乎总是 SEO 中最麻烦的事情，但也是成功最要紧的因素。
链接构造需要创意，推进，通常还需要预算。不会有重复的链接构造。
构造链接的方式取决于你的网站和个性。下面是三种基本的链接获取方式：

"Natural" Editorial Links
Links that are given naturally by sites and pages that want to link to your 
content or company. These links require no specific action from the SEO, other 
than the creation of worthy material (great content) and the ability to create 
awareness about it.

“中立的” 社论链接
链接自然地出现在想要链接你的网站的站点和页面上。
这些链接在 SEO 的时候，不同于创作有价值的素材让别人察觉到它，并不需要特别的处理。

Manual "Outreach" Link Building
The SEO creates these links by emailing bloggers for links, submitting sites to 
directories, or paying for listings of any kind. The SEO often creates a value 
proposition by explaining to the link target why creating the link is in their 
best interest. Examples include filling out forms for submissions to a website 
award program or convincing a professor that your resource is worthy of 
inclusion on the public syllabus.

人工 “外联” 的链接构造
SEO 通过给博客们发邮件，提交站点，或者花钱让链接在任何地方曝光。
SEO 通过给链接目标阐述为什么加上这些链接可以让他们获益来构造价值主张。
包括填写表单提交给网站颁奖节目，说服一个教授你的网站资源可以出现在他的教学大纲里。

Self-Created, Non-Editorial
Hundreds of thousands of websites offer any visitor the opportunity to create 
links through guest book signings, forum signatures, blog comments, or user 
profiles. These links offer the lowest value, but can, in the aggregate, still 
have an impact for some sites. In general, search engines continue to devalue 
most of these types of links, and have been known to penalize sites that pursue 
these links aggressively. Today, these types of links are often considered spammy 
and should be pursued with caution.

自创的非社论链接
大量的网站都允许访客通过留言板、论坛签名、博客评论、用户信息来创建链接。
这些链接具有很小的价值，但是仍然可以影响你的网站。
通常，搜索引擎继续降低绝大部分这种链接的影响，并且知道惩罚积极推行这些链接的网站。
目前，这些类型的链接通常被视为垃圾信息，应该被小心对待。

It's up to you, as an SEO, to select which of these will have the highest 
return on the effort invested. As a general rule, it's wise to build as vast and 
varied a link profile as possible, as this brings the best search engine results. 
Any link building pattern that appears non-standard, unnatural, or manipulative 
will eventually become a target for advancing search algorithms to discount.

作为一名 SEO ，使用哪种方式可以获得最高的回报取决于你。
通常，需要构建一个尽可能广泛，多元化的链接信息。
任何一个看起来不标准、不自然、人为的链接构建模式都最终成为搜索算法打折的对象。

### Starting a link building compaign

### 发起链接构造广告

As with any marketing activity, the first step in any link building campaign is 
the creation of goals and strategies. Unfortunately, link building is one of the 
most difficult activities to measure. Although the engines internally weigh each 
link with precise, mathematical metrics, it's impossible for those on the outside 
to access this information.

和其他市场活动一样，链接构造广告的首要就是定下目标和策略。
不幸的是，链接构造的成功很难衡量。
虽然搜索引擎内部对每个链接赋予精确的权重，数学基准，但这些信息是无法从外部获取到的。

SEOs rely on a number of signals to help build a rating scale of link value. 
Along with the data from the link signals mentioned above, these metrics include 
the following:

SEO 们依赖一些信号来帮助链接价值评级。
在之前提到的链接信号里，这些指标包含：

- Ranking for Relevant Search Terms
  One of the best ways to determine how highly a search engine values a given page 
  is to search for some of the keywords and phrases that page targets (particularly 
  those in the title tag and headline). For example, if you are trying to rank for 
  the phrase "dog kennel," earning links from pages that already rank for this 
  phrase would help significantly.

- 在相关搜索中的排名
  判断搜索引擎给予页面多高的价值的最佳方式之一就是搜索页面的目标关键词和短语（特别是在标题栏和页头部分的）。
  比如，如果你想要获取 "dog kennel" 的排名，从已经拥有排名的页面上获取链接将会帮助很多。
  
- MozRank
  MozRank (mR) shows how popular a given web page is on the web. Pages with high 
  MozRank scores tend to rank better. The more links to a given page, the more 
  popular it becomes. Links from important pages (like www.cnn.com or www.irs.gov) 
  increase a page's popularity, and subsequently its MozRank, more than unpopular websites.

  A page's MozRank can be improved by getting lots of links from semi-popular pages, 
  or a few links from very popular pages.

- MozRank
  MozRank 会显示一个页面在网络上有多热门。
  拥有高 MozRank 评分的页面在排名上也会倾向更高。指向一个页面的链接更多，页面就更热门。
  来自重要页面 (www.cnn.com, www.irs.gov) 的链接增加热门度，并随之增加 MozRank 评分。

  页面的 MozRank 评分可以通过在很多半热门的网站上获取链接来提高，也可以通过在非常热门的网站上获取少量链接来达成。

- Domain Authority
  Moz Domain Authority (or DA) is a query-independent measure of how likely a domain 
  is to rank for any given query. DA is calculated by analyzing the Internet's domain 
  graph and comparing a given domain to tens of thousands of queries in Google.

- 域名权威
  Moz 域名权威是一个无关查询的，度量某个查询和域名相关性的排名。
  域名权威通过分析因特网域名图像，比较某个域名和 Google 千分之十次查询计算得出。

- Competitor's Backlinks
  By examining the backlinks (inbound links) of a website that already ranks well 
  for your targeted keyword phrase, you gain valuable intelligence about the links 
  that help them achieve this ranking. Using tools like Open Site Explorer, SEOs 
  can discover these links and target these domains in their own link building campaigns.

- 竞争者的反向链接
  通过在一个目标关键词上排名良好的网站上实验反向链接，你将会获得关于排名有价值的链接信息。
  通过使用类似 Open Site Explorer 的工具，SEO 工作者可以挖掘出在链接构造中有价值的链接和域名。 

- Number of Links on a Page
  According to the original PageRank formula, the value that a link passes is diluted 
  by the presence of other links on a page. Thus, all other things being equal, 
  being linked to by a page with few links is better than being linked to by a page 
  with many links. The degree to which this is relevant is unknowable (in our testing, 
  it appears to be important, but not overwhelmingly so), but it's certainly 
  something to be aware of as you conduct your link acquisition campaign.

- Potential Referral Traffic
  Link building should never be solely about search engines. Links that send high 
  amounts of direct click-through traffic not only tend to provide better search 
  engine value for rankings, but also send targeted, valuable visitors to your site 
  (the basic goal of all Internet marketing). This is something you can estimate 
  based on the numbers of visits or page views according to site analytics. If you 
  can't get access to these, services like Google Trends can give you a rough idea 
  of at least domain-wide traffic, although these estimates are known to be wildly
  inaccurate at times.


It takes time, practice, and experience to build comfort with these variables as 
they relate to search engine traffic. However, using your websites analytics, 
you should be able to determine whether your campaign is successful.

Success comes when you see increases in search traffic, higher rankings, more 
frequent search engine crawling and increases in referring link traffic. 
If these metrics do not rise after a successful link building campaign, it's 
possible you either need to seek better quality link targets, or improve your 
on-page optimization.


Five Samples of Link Building Strategies
Get your customers to link to you
If you have partners you work with regularly, or loyal customers that love your 
brand, you can capitalize on this by sending out partnership badges—graphic icons 
that link back to your site (like Google often does with their AdWords 
certification program). Just as you'd get customers wearing your t-shirts or 
sporting your bumper stickers, links are the best way to accomplish the same 
feat on the web. Check out this post on e-commerce links for more.
Build a company blog; make it a valuable, informative, and entertaining resource
This content and link building strategy is so popular and valuable that it's one 
of the few recommended personally by the engineers at Google (for more on this, 
see articles at USA Today and Stone Temple). Blogs have the unique ability to 
contribute fresh material on a consistent basis, participate in conversations 
across the web, and earn listings and links from other blogs, including blogrolls 
and blog directories.
Create content that inspires viral sharing and natural linking
In the SEO world, we often call this "linkbait." Good examples might include 
David Mihm's Local Search Ranking Factors, Compare the Meerkat, or the funny How 
Not To Clean a Window. Each leverages aspects of usefulness, information 
dissemination, or humor to create a viral effect. Users who see it once want to 
share it with friends, and bloggers/tech-savvy webmasters who see it will often 
do so through links. Such high quality, editorially earned votes are invaluable 
to building trust, authority, and rankings potential.
Be newsworthy
Earning the attention of the press, bloggers and news media is an effective, 
time-honored way to earn links. Sometimes this is as simple as giving away 
something for free, releasing a great new product, or stating something controversial.

The link building activities you engage in depend largely on the type of site you're working with.

For smaller sites, manual link building, including directories, link requests, 
and link exchanges may be a part of the equation. With larger sites, these tactics 
tend to fall flat and more scalable solutions are required. Sample strategies are 
listed here, though this is by no means an exhaustive list (see Moz's Blog Posts on Link Building for more).

Search for sites like yours by using keywords and phrases directly relevant to 
your business. When you locate sites that aren't directly competitive, email them, 
use their online forms, call them on the phone, or even send them a letter by 
mail to start a conversation about getting a link. Check out this blog post on 
link requests for more detail.

Show Me the Money
An aside on buying links
Google and Bing seek to discount the influence of paid links in their organic 
search results. While it is impossible for them to detect and discredit all paid 
links, the search engines put a lot of time and resources into finding ways to 
detect these. Websites caught buying links or participating in link schemes risk 
severe penalties that will drop their rankings into oblivion. Notwithstanding 
these efforts, link buying sometimes works; many search professionals wish the 
search engines would do even more to discourage it.

We at Moz recommend spending your time on long-term link building strategies 
that focus on building links naturally.
